<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who took part in that strange
camping out of the School in 1876 and 1877 will be glad to be
reminded of their experiences now they are over.&nbsp; And
perhaps the School at Uppingham, in years to come, may like to
have some hint, however imperfect, of that medley of ruin and
safety, fear and fun, which passed from risk and danger, which
seemed almost impossible to be faced, to a happy ending.</p>

THE PROLOGUE.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O <span
class="smcap">swallow</span>, with resistless wing, that
hold&rsquo;st the air in fee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O swallow, with thy joyous sweep o&rsquo;er earth
and sunlit sea,<br />
O swallow, who, if night were thine, would&rsquo;st wheel amongst
the stars,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why linger round the eaves?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy! free of all the world hast knit thy soul to
clay?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And glued thy heart up on the wall, thou swiftest
child of day?<br />
Claim, glorious wing, thy heritage; break, break thy prison
bars,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nor linger round the eaves.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep, glorious wings, adown
the wind; fly, swallow, to the west;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before thee, life and liberty; behind, a ruined
nest.<br />
Blow, freshening breeze, sweep, rapid wing, for all the winds are
thine,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The nest is only clay.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid wings were stretched in flight, the
swallow sped away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And left its nest beneath the eaves, the much-loved
bit of clay,<br />
Turned with the sun, to go where&rsquo;er the happy sun might
shine,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And passed into the day.</p>

THE SUMMONS.</h2>
<p class="poetry">A <span class="smcap">thousand</span> year is
nought to prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, so <span class="smcap">God</span> it
will:<br />
So the chapel fair, in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
clear air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks calmly from its hill;</p>
<p class="poetry">And true and bold the schoolhouse old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it sentinel,<br />
With close at hand a trusty band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of comrades guards it well.</p>
<p class="poetry">Each morn they meet, the young, young feet,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lightly come and go,<br />
A changeful stream, that still doth seem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same, and still doth flow.</p>
<p class="poetry">The stream shall run while shines the sun,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still the buttressed stone<br />
Shall hear the beat of young, young feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And count them all its own.</p>
<p class="poetry">The fair sun shone, but ghastly and wan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There came a spectral dream;<br />
The stone stood fast, but a dim fear passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through buttress, and roof, and beam:</p>
<p class="poetry">With sad, sad heart life did depart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A ghostly silence fell;<br />
With sad, sad heart they turned to depart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And&mdash;farewell, home, farewell.</p>

THOUGHTS.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Darkest</span> clouds drop
tender rain,<br />
Every leaf and blade is fain<br />
Its own jewel to obtain<br />
From the casket of its pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the thunder, black as night,<br />
Down descends in orbs of white,<br />
For the sun to fill with light,<br />
Tiny chambers of his might.</p>
<p class="poetry">Precious beads of hope are pearled<br />
On each sorrow through the world,<br />
Softest dews of peace in showers<br />
Lie beneath the clouded hours.</p>

THE JOURNEY.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> ice froze cold,
as cold as death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet runs the stream below;<br />
The very spring breathes bitter breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still the flowerets blow.<br />
Nor shall it perish from the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The living seed they bore,<br />
As forth they fared, that pilgrim band,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As pilgrims went of yore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lead, river, down the mountain glen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glide &rsquo;mid the sunny slopes;<br />
Now lose thyself, now come again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en like a pilgrim&rsquo;s hopes.<br />
And careless rivulets with their peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiled on the passers-by,<br />
From many a valley, where the trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See but their own dear sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">So swept they on a great bright plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A charm&egrave;d breadth out-laid,<br />
Where mountains rounded to the main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A charm&egrave;d circle made;<br />
And northward couched a huge hill dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which ofttimes, as it lay.<br />
To heave and pant in sleep did seem,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the sultry day.</p>
<p class="poetry">And leaning up against the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose headland, purple-black,<br />
The southern waters, as they fill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiss daily, and fall back,<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>A simple
hamlet, nowise planned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Puts out a long arm white,<br />
Where level sea and level sand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce know each other&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p class="poetry">The mountains rule the east, but all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The west, the sea, the sea;<br />
Save when the sun at evenfall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disputes her sovereignty.<br />
A kindly people held the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A kindly race and free;<br />
So rest they found, that pilgrim band,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Borth beside the sea.</p>

THE SEA.&mdash;SAFETY.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bright</span> sea, in thy
waters rolled<br />
Dost eternity enfold,<br />
Endless being, uncontrolled,<br />
Freedom, more than heart can hold,<br />
Every wave a hope divine,<br />
Sun-charms, golden line on line,<br />
Thou great moving mystery-shrine!<br />
Thine the first sounds that the earth<br />
Heard, its cradle-song at birth.<br />
Hidden voices in thy deep<br />
Half untold their secret keep,<br />
As they murmur evermore<br />
Old-world tidings to the shore.<br />
Glorious sea, thy moving light<br />
Spreads round earth a mantle bright,<br />
Wide as range of eye or mind,<br />
Tameless playmate of the wind.<br />
Like a shuttle glancing free<br />
In and out, thy life, O sea,<br />
Whatsoe&rsquo;er thy mood hath been,<br />
Weaves a web of magic sheen.<br />
Gracious wandering life, the air<br />
Sports around thee for its share;<br />
Winds that move, and winds that rest,<br />
Heaving softly on thy breast,<br />
Like a sea-bird from the crest,<br />
Rise from off thy waves, and fly,<br />
Sweeping fresh the summer sky.<br />
Glorious sea, glad, unconfined,<br />
Free as range of eye or mind,<br />
Tameless playmate of the wind,<br />
Gracious power, whate&rsquo;er thou be,<br />
Lay thy sweetest liberty<br />
At the pilgrims&rsquo; feet, O sea.</p>

fill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye choose ye valleys sweet,<br />
Where o&rsquo;er the water-song the dim woods rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your votaries to meet,<br />
And sweetest far your home where Lery bright<br />
Plays in your smile with pebbles and the light.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find you where we left you
last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that glad summer noon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We turned to go, half gay, half sad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An end had come so soon;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just where the wider sweep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oak, and fern, and purple
heather clad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curves from the shoulder steep,<br />
Whereon ye watch the streamlet down the glade<br />
Send its white thoughts through narrowing glooms of shade.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; On a clear bed of rock;<br />
And the next moment tossed about,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fairy shuttlecock;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in a still pool deep,<br />
Heart laid to heart in chambers hollowed out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The quiet wood doth sleep.<br />

The Lery down the vale a soul of joy doth stray.</p>

For happy time recks not of mortal clock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The children of last year.<br />
Our fishers throw, while on the pebbly ridge<br />
Tea boils, and rash feet shake the miner&rsquo;s bridge.</p>

To drop another shadow on the rill,<br />

The sleeping princess of our summer bliss.</p>

Pell-mell from smoke-witted man,<br />
Scared from haunted well and tree<br />
Fairy mermaidens to be,<br />
Colonists of fairy sea;<br />
Empire found, and perils o&rsquo;er,<br />
Soon ye peeped out on the shore,<br />
Frolic-bold as heretofore;<br />
Village green and woodland spells<br />
Lightly changed for shells O, shells!<br />
Your sea besoms twice a day<br />
Swish, and swirl, and hissing spray,<br />
Brush all mortal taint away.<br />
Twice a day the saucy waves,<br />
Heads bent low, your merry slaves,<br />
Tumble in of shells a store<br />
From the sea-king&rsquo;s palace floor.<br />
On a day remembered well,<br />
Never butterfly befell<br />
Brighter bursting from his cell,<br />
Picked we the first fairy shell.<br />

Youth and Age together sprung<br />
In a world where all was young.<br />
Age was young and Youth as old,<br />
Age and Youth, two children bold,<br />
Caught old Time with potent spells,<br />
Magic words of shells O, shells!<br />

Opening into some bright dream,<br />

All around us as we stept.<br />

In the waves, when day is done.<br />
Here a ripple in and out<br />
Mocking whirls the Cones about,<br />
Brings them to our fingers, then<br />
Laughs, and swings them off again.<br />
There a dark line softly lies<br />
Rich in promise &rsquo;neath the skies;<br />
Happy he foredoomed to burst<br />

Thunder-driven, blind, and pale,<br />
Beat on rovers bent, subdued,<br />
Each apart in solitude,<br />
Nursing his own woeful mood.<br />
Lo! a shell bank&mdash;at the cry<br />
Sunshine flashed along the sky,<br />
Reckless-bright each sunny eye<br />
Glistened, on the spoil they fly,<br />

Ere the tender dew had died<br />
Hopeless, on the mountain-side,<br />
And away the fairies hied.<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
